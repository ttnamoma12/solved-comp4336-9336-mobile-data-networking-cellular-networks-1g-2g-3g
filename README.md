Q1.




The distance between cell centers with the same frequency band is required to be more than 6 km. What is the cell radius for the cluster size of 12.




Q2.




Using the NxSxK notation, label the frequency re-use patterns below:




(a)
















(b)
















(c)







(d)










Q3.




Consider a cluster size of 7 for <em>fractional</em> frequency re-use in hexagonal cellular networks. Assume that each cell is allocated an identical set of 7 frequencies, F1 to F7, to be used within the cell. Draw a cluster of 7 cells showing the frequency use in the centers and borders of the cells.




Q4.




A particular cellular system has the following characteristics: cluster size =9, uniform cell size, user density=100 users/sq km, allocated frequency spectrum = 900-945 MHz, bit rate required per user = 10 kbps uplink and 10 kbps downlink, and modulation code rate = 2 bps/Hz. Answer the following questions.




<ul>

 <li>Using FDMA/FDD:</li>

</ul>




<ol>

 <li>How much bandwidth is available per cell using FDD?</li>

 <li>How many users per cell can be supported using FDMA?</li>

 <li>What is the cell area</li>

 <li>What is the cell radius assuming circular cells?</li>

</ol>










<ul>

 <li>If the available spectrum is divided in to 100 channels and TDMA is employed within each channel:</li>

</ul>




<ol>

 <li>What is the bandwidth and data rate per channel?</li>

 <li>How many time slots are needed in a TDMA frame to support the required number of users?</li>

 <li>If the TDMA frame is 10ms, how long is each user slot in the frame?</li>

 <li>How many bits are transmitted in each time slot?</li>

</ol>
